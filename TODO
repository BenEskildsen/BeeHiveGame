- workers w/roles and tasks
  - tasks:
    - standby
      - random movement
    - feeding larva
      - track food need
      - find honey and pick it up
      - find larva and drop it off
    - building cells
      - assign areas for building
      - go to area and do an action there
    - scouting for food
      - leave screen for certain amount of time
      - come back (with certain probability) with info about food
    - retrieving food
      - leave screen for certain amount of time
      - come back (with certain probability) with food
  - how to assign tasks?
    - dance placeholder

- other economics
  - nectar -> honey
  - additional process for getting honey

- all movements (standby cadence, etc). should be in time with music
